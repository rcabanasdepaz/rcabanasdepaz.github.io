## publications
My field of research has focused on the field of machine learning from a
probabilistic approach through probabilistic graphical models and Bayesian statistics.
As a result of this work, I have published 22 articles in journals indexed in the JCR
(10 of them in journals of the first quartile), 1 book chapter and 30 articles in relevant
international conferences in their field of interest, where three of them are
established international conferences as a reference in the area (Core A*). In one of
them being the only author. I am reviewer for conferences such as ECML, ICML, ICLR and NIPS. 
He also participates or has participated
as a reviewer in prestigious journals in the area such as Information Sciences,
IEEE Transactions Systems, Menand Cybernetics Part B, Journal of the American Statistical
Association, Knolwedge-based Systems and Journal of Machine Learning Research.

## research projects

I am a principal investigator of a project for young researchers of the Ministry of
Economy and Competitiveness with a budget of 172 thousand euros. I have also been
principal investigator of the project "Discretization of expression quantitative
trait loci for learning with machine learning models" funded in a competitive call
at the University of Granada. In addition, it has participated in 1 a European project,
6 research projects of the national research plan, 1 project of the AVANZA2 plan and
2 projects of the Andalusian science program, among others.

## technology transfer

I has also worked on different problems of technology transfer in collaboration
with companies from different sectors: Gobile, for problems of customer sectorization;
Gobile, for problems of geographic prediction of crimes; Corporate Credit Bank,
for a problem of early identification of defaults; Daimler, for a problem of
recognition of traffic maneuvers; and Verdande Technology, for the early detection
of problems in oil drilling.
